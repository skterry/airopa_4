\begin{abstract}
We present an analysis of six independent on-sky datasets taken with the Keck-II/NIRC2 instrument. Using the off-axis point spread function (PSF) reconstruction software AIROPA, we extract stellar astrometry, photometry, and other fitting metrics in order to characterize the performance of this package. We test the effectiveness of AIROPA to reconstruct the PSF across the field of view in varying atmospheric conditions, number and location of PSF reference stars, stellar crowding and telescope position angle (PA). We compare the astrometric precision and fitting residuals between a static PSF model and a spatially varying PSF model that incorporates instrumental aberrations and atmospheric turbulence during exposures. We find consistent astrometric performance and goodness-of-fit values across all datasets, with a ${\sim}15$\% smaller astrometric uncertainty for variable-PSF mode over single-PSF mode in the best case. We largely confirm that the spatially variable PSF does not significantly improve the astrometric and/or PSF fitting residuals over the static PSF for on-sky observations. We attribute this to unaccounted instrumental aberrations that are not characterized through afternoon adaptive optics (AO) bench calibrations.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
With the next generation of adaptive optics (AO) instruments coming online soon, it is becoming increasingly important to properly characterize the spatial and temporal dependence of the point spread function (PSF) for data obtained with AO. The Keck-I and Keck-II AO systems have been used to deliver very high-resolution imaging for well over two decades, and have been continuously upgraded and fitted with newer generation hardware. The future of both Keck telescopes is filled with several promising next-generation updates \cite{wizinowich:2020a, bond:2020a}.

\indent As a result of imperfect knowledge of the spatially varying (i.e. off-axis) PSF in these AO systems, very precise astrometry and photometry for a large majority of stellar sources in crowded fields (for example) has been limited. The Anisoplanatic and Instrumental Reconstruction of Off-axis PSFs for AO (AIROPA) is a suite of software packages that utilizes phase diversity measurements, atmospheric profile data, and wave propagation through both turbulence and optical systems. With this knowledge, AIROPA generates a model of the field-dependent PSF for both natural guide star (NGS) and laser guide star (LGS) modes. The software functions under the assumption that every PSF that is extracted consists of a convolution of; the on-axis PSF, the instrumental aberration, and the atmospheric anisoplanatism \cite{do:2018a}. Further descriptions of AIROPA and the sub-modules that it is built upon are given in \cite{witzel:2016a}.

\indent AIROPA and its sub-modules are described in \cite{witzel:2016a}, for context we give a brief description of the input data needed for AIROPA. These data are used to generate the OTF grids (instrumental + atmospheric), on-axis + off-axis PSFs, and other files for the subsequent photometric and astrometric analyses. Instrumental aberration maps are generated by conducting fiber phase diversity measurements at the detector plane for NIRC2. A grid of phase maps is generated, where each map is the result of the difference between the measured on-axis wavefront and off-axis wavefront across the 1024x1024 pixel field. Since the instrumental phase maps are mostly static \cite{Ciurlo:inprep}, the instrumental OTF can be read in from a pre-determined library of OTFs at various rotator angles. This significantly increases efficiency and reduces computation time for a given AIROPA analysis. The multi-aperture scintillation sensor (MASS) and differential image motion monitor (DIMM) are instruments on the summit of Mauna Kea that monitor the seeing and generate atmopheric profiles ($C_n^{2}$) at altitudes of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 kilometers (km) above the summit. The algorithm that feeds this seeing information into AIROPA is called ARROYO \cite{britton:2006a}, and is built upon a set of C++ libraries. The AIROPA-generated OTF then represents the combination of the instrumental phase maps and atmospheric profile that are needed in order to construct the field-dependent PSF model. The PSF extraction and fitting is performed on each science image and final star lists are generated with photometry and astrometry for each detected source. Additionally, we rely on a ``goodness-of-fit" metric deemed the fraction of variance unexplained (FVU), for determining how well the PSF model has fit the data in each image. For a schematic on the variable-PSF algorithm in AIROPA, we refer to Figure 1 in \cite{Turri:inprep}.

\indent This study is the fourth in a series of papers detailing the AIROPA package; \cite{witzel:2016a} introduces AIROPA and gives an overview of the software structure. Characterization of the Keck-II/NIRC2 instrumental aberrations and AIROPA's usage of this aberration data is given in \cite{Ciurlo:inprep}, and \cite{Turri:inprep} perform tests of AIROPA on simulated and on-sky Galactic Center (GC) images. In this paper we focus on expanding the on-sky tests of AIROPA. The paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:gc-data} describes the analysis of a very crowded field through three independent GC datasets. In Section \ref{sec:ogle-data}, we describe a less-crowded field for a typical gravitational microlensing science case. In Section \ref{sec:m53-data} we detail the observations of globular cluster Messier 53 (M53) taken at various position angles (PA). In Section \ref{sec:fvu-astrom-results} we compare the photometric, astrometric, and FVU results for each science case. Finally, we give a discussion and conclude the paper in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Observations} \label{sec:observations}
All datasets presented in this work were acquired on Keck-II with the Near-Infrared Camera 2 (NIRC2) narrow camera instrument in laser guide star adaptive optics (LGSAO) mode and with the K$_\textrm{p}$ filter ($\lambda_{c} = 2.12 \mu m$). The plate scale for the NIRC2 narrow camera is 9.942 mas/pix, and all the data were taken between May 2015 and August 2017.

\end{figure}

\indent A total of six cleaned frames from each dataset were reduced identically with a NIRC2 pipeline to correct instrumental effects \cite{ghez:2008a, lu:2008a} and apply geometric distortion corrections \cite{lu:2008a, service:2016a}. North is up and East is left in all observations, with one exception for the PA $=$ 90 observations where East is up and South is left. Figure \ref{fig:dimmmass_datasets} shows the median Strehl and FWHM values and standard deviations for all datasets analyzed in this work. The right panel of Figure \ref{fig:dimmmass_datasets} shows the atmosphere profile information from the DIMM/MASS instruments for each dataset, with grey shaded regions representing the time of observation considered in this analysis. The observation timestamps span 8:30pm to 4:30am local Hawaiian Standard Time (HST). Table \ref{tab:fields-metrics} shows the quality metrics (i.e. median SR/FWHM/RMS WFE), observation dates, and total exposure times for all datasets.

There are many reasons to include a wide range of variable condition data across different stellar fields on-sky, which include; testing the effects of varying DIMM/MASS profiles on PSF extraction (Section \ref{sec:gc-data}), testing the fitting precision on datasets with more/less PSF reference stars in the field (i.e. crowded/sparse fields, Sections \ref{sec:ogle-data} and \ref{sec:m53-data}), and determining the reliability of goodness-of-fit and other PSF fitting residuals for extracted sources (Section \ref{sec:fvu-astrom-results}).

\subsection{Comparing Atmospheric Conditions in a Very Crowded Field: The Galactic Center} \label{sec:gc-data}
We expand upon the initial on-sky GC testing of \cite{Turri:inprep} by including ``good quality", ``average quality", and ``poor quality" datasets (hereafter GQ, AQ, and PQ respectively) for further AIROPA validations on the GC. The GC case was used as the main science driver for the original development of AIROPA. This case is ideal since there already exists a rich high-resolution dataset spanning several decades, dozens of reference stars for PSF modeling, and a very bright, uniform tip/tilt (TT) guide star that is ${\sim}13$ arcseconds off-axis. The longest-running high-resolution study of the stellar population immediately surrounding Sgr A$^{*}$ is being conducted by the Galactic Center Orbit Initiative\footnote[1]{\url{https://galacticcenter.astro.ucla.edu/}}.
This work has led to a deep and well-understood knowledge \cite{ghez:2005b, ghez:2008a, lu:2008a, do:2019a, gautam:2019a} of the environment immediately surrounding the central supermassive black hole.

\end{figure}

\indent We rank the three GC datasets, GQ, AQ, and PQ based on the historical quality of all GC epochs taken with NIRC2 since 2004 \cite{jia:2019a}. The GQ dataset was taken on 2017-08-11, The AQ data were taken $\sim$two weeks after the GQ data, on 2017-08-23, and the PQ data were taken on 2016-05-03. For all GC datasets, each frame was composed of 10 coadded exposures at 2.8s per coadd for a total exposure time of 28s per frame. One note about the PQ dataset; there does not exist phase diversity calibration data from 2016, therefore the 2017 instrumental phase maps were used to substitute for the 2016 phase maps. This is not an issue, as \cite{Ciurlo:inprep} show that the phase maps can remain stable across multiple years, and any potential difference between 2016 and 2017 phase diversity is likely small enough for an analysis of the kind presented in this work. Figure \ref{fig:gc_images} shows one frame from each of the three epochs, with the spatial scale given as the separation (in arcseconds) from the on-axis position (i.e. image center). Figure \ref{fig:fwhm_grids} shows the grid of FWHM values measured by AIROPA variable-PSF mode for each frame, plotted over the field of view to give a visualization of the field-dependent PSF. The FWHM grid values are calculated for every PSF generated by AIROPA in the PSF grid file, \textit{*\_psf\_grid.fits}. The AIROPA grid files for the fields analyzed in this work use a partition size (i.e. step width of the PSF grid) of 102.

\subsection{A Less Crowded Field: OGLE-2015-BLG-0029} \label{sec:ogle-data}
The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey \cite{udalski:1992a} conducts wide-field visible and near-IR imaging of nearly the entire Galactic Bulge region at high cadence and detects over 1000 microlensing events every season. Most ground-based imaging data from current microlensing surveys are focused on the regions $3\degree > l > 357\degree$ and $-2.5\degree < b < 2.5\degree$. The first non-GC data analyzed in this work is OGLE-2015-BLG-0029 (hereafter OB150029), located at RA $=$ 17:59:46.60, DEC $=$ -28:38:41.80 and Galactic coordinates ($l,b = (1.828\degree, -2.523\degree$)). This target has been regularly monitored with NIRC2 since 2015 as part of a project to study isolated stellar-mass black hole candidates \cite{lu:inprep}.

\begin{figure}[!h]

 \caption{\footnotesize \textit{Left}: NIRC2 frame of the OB150029 field taken on 2016-07-14 with the Kp filter. \textit{Right}: FWHM grid from AIROPA variable-PSF mode with selected PSF reference stars colored by magnitude and solid line connecting the on-axis position to the TT guide star.} \label{fig:ob150029}
\end{figure}

The OB150029 observations were taken on 2016-07-14 in LGSAO mode with the Kp filter. Each of the frames consist of six co-added images, each with five second integration time, for a total integration time of 30 seconds per frame. The airmass during the six-frame observing window was $\sim$1.65, and the median Strehl, FWHM, and RMS WFE values for the six frames are given in Table \ref{tab:fields-metrics}, as well as the DIMM/MASS data given on the right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:dimmmass_datasets}. This is the second-best dataset (behind GQ) in terms of quality metrics like the median Strehl and FWHM and their variances across all six frames. Similar to the PQ dataset, there are no 2016 phase maps available for NIRC2, therefore the 2017 maps were substituted. Again, phase diversity measurements have shown these maps to be remarkably stable across several years \cite{Ciurlo:inprep}. Figure \ref{fig:ob150029} shows a NIRC2 image of the field, which is clearly less crowded than the GC, particularly in the bright star regime. 

\indent There are a total of 10 PSF reference stars in this field that were used for AIROPA, compared to a total of 25 PSF reference stars used for the GC analysis described in Section \ref{sec:gc-data}. The total number and spatial location of selected PSF reference stars is important for constructing accurate PSF models, and the 10 stars chosen for the OB150029 field include the microlensing target itself (i.e. brightest star in the field), as well as stars within 1.5 mag of the target, and separations of $\pm4$ arcseconds from the target. The TT guide star used for the observations has an R mag ${\sim}$15.1 and separation of ${\sim}$13.8 arcseconds to the Southwest of the target, as indicated by the solid line in the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:ob150029}.

%----------------AIROPA ON M53------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Comparing Different Position Angles: Globular Cluster M53} \label{sec:m53-data}
The globular cluster M53 (NGC 5024) located at RA $=$ 13:12:54.51, DEC $=$ 18:10:13.95 was observed with the NIRC2 narrow camera Kp filter on 2015-05-04 as part of a project to characterize the NIRC2 geometric distortion \cite{service:2016a}. This was accomplished by comparing the NIRC2 stellar positions to precise astrometry from \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) \textit{Advanced Camera for Surveys} (ACS) observations \cite{anderson:2008a}. The NIRC2 camera and AO system was realigned in April 2015, and observations of M53 before and after this realignment show an increase in the average geometric distortion from $\sim$0.5 mas pre-realignment to $\sim$1.1 mas post-realignment.

\begin{figure}[!h]
 \makebox[\textwidth][c]{
 \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figures/quad-m53.pdf}
 }
 \caption{\footnotesize \textit{Left Column}: M53 NIRC2 frame taken at PA = 0, with accompanying FWHM grid generated by AIROPA. \textit{Right Column}: Same as left, but for PA = 90. The solid line connects the on-axis LGS position to the TT guide star. The color scale is identical for both images in the top row.} \label{fig:m53_image_grid}
\end{figure}

Importantly for the current study, the M53 NIRC2 observations were taken at two different position angles (PA); 0$\degree$ and 90$\degree$. These observations present a unique dataset for us to compare the astrometric accuracy between single-PSF and variable-PSF modes in AIROPA as a function of PA. The previous study of \cite{service:2016a} assumed a static PSF to derive the geometric distortion solution, which implies that using a variable-PSF on NIRC2 datasets will likely show residual distortion that was not modeled out by the static PSF used to derive the solution. Depending on the significance of this effect, some fraction of the difference in astrometric, photometric, or FVU results between the PSF modes may be attributed to this (Figures \ref{fig:m53_PA_compare}, \ref{fig:m53_PA_compare_hst}, and \ref{fig:m53_PA_compare_gaia}). As our intention in this paper is not to fully derive a new geometric distortion solution (with single and/or variable-PSF), we select only a subset of M53 NIRC2 images to remain consistent with the number of GC and microlensing frames used in previous sections. While it may prove beneficial to fully derive a new independent variable-PSF distortion solution for NIRC2, this is beyond the scope of the current paper. As shown in \cite{Turri:inprep}, the astrometric differences between single-PSF mode and variable-PSF mode become more severe at larger radii from the central on-axis position. This is predominantly caused by the difference in PSF shape between the spatially varying model and the static model, particularly closer to the sides and edges of the NIRC2 frame. However there is evidence that residual instrumental aberrations still persist in the system \cite{Turri:inprep}. Recently, it has also been shown that a dominant source of error in the PSF comes from primary segment misalignments (O. Beltramo-Martin in private communication). The work shows several hundred nanometers (nm) of wavefront error (WFE) coming from the primary piston segments, which can become misaligned as quickly as hours after initial alignment. Currently, the Keck-II primary mirror segments are realigned every two-weeks, however these results suggest the cadence may need to be increased in order to minimize any contribution to the PSF error from this primary segment phasing.

The M53 dataset includes six frames taken at a position angle of 0\degree (North up, East left), and six frames taken at a position angle of 90\degree (East up, South left). The PA $=0$ dataset consists of four frames taken at the central pointing, and two frames taken after a dither of $\Delta_x = -0.14", \Delta_y = 0.16"$. The PA $=90$ dataset consists of four frames taken at the central pointing, and two frames taken after a dither of $\Delta_x = +0.14", \Delta_y = -0.19"$. The total exposure time is 50 seconds per frame for both PAs. Figure \ref{fig:m53_image_grid} shows one frame taken at PA 0 and the accompanying grid of FWHM values from AIROPA variable-PSF mode, as well as a PA 90 frame and FWHM grid. The same TT guide star was used for both PAs, which has magnitude R ${\sim}$ 13.5 located 24 arcseconds to the Southwest.

AIROPA was run on all images at each PA using the same 10 PSF reference stars which are shown as data points colored by magnitude in the bottom panels of Figure \ref{fig:m53_image_grid}. Both the variable and single-PSF mode astrometric and photometric extractions were performed on each image. Additionally, stellar positions and magnitudes from the four central-pointing PA $=0$ frames were then averaged, and the averaged star list was transformed to the reference star list frame. We used the PA$=$90 averaged star list as the master reference list since measurably more sources are detected and the data is of higher quality than PA$=$0; $\overline{\textrm{SR}}_{0\degree} = 0.76^{*}\overline{\textrm{SR}}_{90\degree}$, $\overline{\textrm{FWHM}}_{0\degree}$ $= 1.14^{*}\overline{\textrm{FWHM}}_{90\degree}$.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
We present the AIROPA single-PSF and variable-PSF results for each field analyzed. As mentioned earlier, to maintain consistency we select a subset of six consecutive frames from each dataset and use the averaged astrometry, photometry, and FVU in our final analysis and comparisons. All of the selected GC data (as well as the microlensing data) have exactly one dither between the first three frames and last three frames, while the M53 data have exactly one dither between the second and third frames (i.e. first two frames at one dither position, last four frames at a subsequent dither position).

Quiver plot shows positional differences as a function of field location. \textit{Bottom row}: 1D positional differences with errors derived from the RMS deviation of six positional measurements.} \label{fig:gc-gq-astrom}
\end{figure}

\indent There are three primary metrics that we use to assess the performance of each PSF mode in AIROPA, these are the photometric uncertainty, astrometric uncertainty, and FVU. As mentioned previously, we expect the varying conditions, data quality, PSF reference stars, and stellar crowding to impact the effectiveness of AIROPA to reconstruct the PSF. Along with instrumental aberrations and atmospheric anisoplanatism, the combination of these factors (on the instrument and on-sky) work to effectively increase the overall noise present in the reconstructed PSFs, stellar profiles, and extracted photometry, astrometry, and FVU. For each dataset, a relative comparison of these metrics between the PSF modes should reveal any differences in the overall PSF-R performance and/or results for each mode. 
\\
\indent In addition to the three primary metrics mentioned above, we also compare the M53 astrometry and photometry from each PSF mode to several external catalogues. We make these comparisons in an attempt to determine which PSF mode gives results that are more consistent with an external reference. As \cite{Turri:inprep} show, there is a clear ``relative" difference in astrometry and photometry between the two PSF modes in AIROPA, however this information alone does not tell us which PSF mode gives a more ``true" result. Performing a comparison like the one described in the subsequent M53 results sections should give evidence of the ``absolute" difference between the two PSF modes and the ``true" result.
\\
\indent Table \ref{tab:PhotAstromFVU-results} gives the photometry, astrometry, and FVU results for all datasets analyzed in this work. The table includes results for all detected stars in each set, as well as results for the brightest stars (i.e. $m_K < 13$), as the PSF residuals at the brightest magnitudes are primarily affected by PSF systematic errors rather than noise \cite{Turri:inprep}.

\subsection{Galactic Center} \label{sec:results-gc}

\indent For the very crowded GC datasets, identical reductions and analyses were performed across each of the six-frame sets. The same 25 PSF reference stars were used in each analysis and the astrometric, photometric, and FVU results are given in the following three sub-sections. Note that for each of the three datasets, we impose a requirement that in order for a star to be included in the subsequent analyses, it must be detected in all six of the cleaned frames.

\subsubsection{GC: Good Quality (GQ)} \label{sec:results-gc-GQ}
\noindent The GQ dataset contains the largest number of stars detected of all data analyzed in this paper. A total of 840 stars were detected in all six GQ frames. Figure \ref{fig:gc-gq-astrom} shows the averaged difference between the measured star positions in single-PSF and variable-PSF modes. The astrometric differences are largest at field locations farther away from center frame, largely due to the difference in PSF shape between the static model and the variable model.
\\
\indent The top right panel of Figure \ref{fig:gc-gq-astrom} shows the field position for each detected star and the corresponding 2D position difference (X,Y) on the detector plane. The 1D differences are shown in the bottom panels of Figure \ref{fig:gc-gq-astrom}. The mean difference in each direction across the detector is $\Delta X_{S-V} = -0.21 \pm 1.33$ mas and $\Delta Y_{S-V} = -0.66 \pm 0.82$.
\\
\indent The average photometric and astrometric precision for all GQ stars is $\sigma_{{m}}{\sim}0.03$ mag and $\sigma_{{r}}{\sim}0.81$ mas, respectively for both single and variable-PSF modes. Further, the average FVU metric is very similar for the variable-PSF mode ($4.67\times10^{-2}$) and single-PSF mode ($4.70\times10^{-2}$). There may be evidence of some improvement in the astrometric errors and FVUs for only the brightest stars in the field (i.e. left column of Figure \ref{fig:gc-astrom}), but any possible improvement here is significantly less than what has been measured on simulation tests \cite{Turri:inprep}.

\subsubsection{GC: Average Quality (AQ)} \label{sec:results-gc-AQ}
The total number of stars detected across all AQ frames is 576, approximately 30\% less than the GQ dataset. As expected, the average uncertainties are marginally larger than those from the GQ dataset. When comparing the results from both PSF modes, we measure marginally smaller uncertainties for the variable-PSF mode over the single-PFS mode. While these results imply that variable-PSF is performing better than single-PSF mode, we note again that these improvements are still well below what has been shown through simulated data tests.
\\
\indent The average photometric precision for the AQ stars is $\sigma_{{m}}{\sim}0.038$ mag for variable-PSF mode and $\sigma_{{m}}{\sim}0.040$ mag for single-PSF mode. Further, the measured astrometric precision is $\sigma_{{r}}{\sim}1.07$ mas for variable-PSF mode and $\sigma_{{r}}{\sim}1.11$ mas for single-PSF mode. Finally, the average FVU metric is smaller (${\sim}10$\%) for the variable-PSF mode ($4.52\times10^{-2}$) compared to single-PSF mode ($5.01\times10^{-2}$).

\subsubsection{GC: Poor Quality (PQ)} \label{sec:results-gc-PQ}
As expected the PQ dataset had the smallest number of detected stars, at 445, this is ${\sim}23$\% less than the AQ dataset and ${\sim}47$\% less than the GQ dataset. As a reminder, Table \ref{tab:fields-metrics} gives the median PSF FWHM for the PQ dataset, $82 \pm 6.6$ mas. This is approximately 30 mas larger than the GQ PSF and approximately 16 mas larger than the AQ PSF.
\\
\indent Similarly to the previous GC datasets, the PQ results show a marginal improvement for the variable-PSF mode compared to single-PSF mode. The astrometric precision for variable-PSF mode ($\sigma_{{r}}{\sim}1.32$ mas) is just 2\% less than single-PSF mode ($\sigma_{{r}}{\sim}1.35$ mas). A better improvement is seen in the photometric precision comparison; variable-PSF mode gives a precision of $\sigma_{{m}}{\sim}0.042$ mag which is ${\sim}10$\% smaller than the single-PSF mode precision ($\sigma_{{m}}{\sim}0.047$). Finally, the average FVU measurement across all detected stars is once again quite similar between the two modes; variable-PSF gives an average FVU of $4.51\times10^{-2}$ while single-PSF gives an average FVU of $4.64\times10^{-2}$.

\subsection{OB150029} \label{sec:results-ob150029}

\indent The microlensing target OB150029 is located in the least-crowded stellar field analyzed in this work, with a total of 63 stars cross-matched between all frames. For this data, 10 reference stars were used for the initial PSF model. Coincidentally, this is the same amount of reference stars as the M53 dataset, and is 60\% fewer reference stars than the GC datasets. We note this dataset has the second-highest measured Strehl Ratio, and smallest FWHM of all datasets analyzed (Table \ref{tab:fields-metrics}). Additionally, as can be seen in the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:ob150029}, this dataset has the smallest variance in FWHM as measured across the field (${\sim}6$ mas).

\end{figure}

\indent For the microlensing target itself, the AIROPA analysis shows a modest improvement of ${\sim}13\%$ in the astrometric precision in variable-PSF mode ($\sigma_{r}=0.223$ mas) over single-PSF mode ($\sigma_{r}=0.252$ mas). The upper-left panel of Figure \ref{fig:ob-m53-astromfvu-ratios} shows the astrometric residuals for all stars detected in both PSF modes, OB150029 is shown by the red data point. The photometric uncertainty and FVU evaluated on the target for both PSF modes are very similar, within 5\% for single-PSF and variable-PSF modes. It should not be surprising that the PSF fitting errors and metrics are quite similar between single-PSF and variable-PSF for the target star in this case since the location of the target on the detector is nearly on-axis (see left panel of Figure \ref{fig:ob150029-targ-res}) and the PSF shapes are not significantly different for the static PSF and the central PSF from the variable-PSF mode. The residual images show effectively identical over-subtracted and under-subtracted features for both PSF modes (middle and right panel of Figure \ref{fig:ob150029-targ-res}). We note there is an unrelated neighbor star approximately 0.36 arcseconds to the SW of the target, with a flux ratio of $f/f_{\textrm{OB150029}}\, {\sim}\, 0.1$. While the stellar profile of this fainter neighbor may have a small absolute effect on the SW wing of the OB150029 PSF, the magnitude of this effect will be the same for each case. Additionally, inspection of the residuals at the location of the nearby neighbor show no statistically significant signal above or below the background noise in both cases.

\indent The left column of Figure \ref{fig:ob-m53-astromfvu-ratios} shows the relationship (i.e. ratio) between the fitting metrics as a function of magnitude, and Table \ref{tab:PhotAstromFVU-results} reports the results for each metric and PSF mode. Generally, the same trend appears in the microlensing dataset as the GC datasets; a marginal improvement in the precision and fitting residuals in variable-PSF mode compared to single-PSF mode. The largest improvement is seen in both astrometric precision and FVU for variable-PSF mode, ${\sim} 10\%$ smaller than the single-PSF mode results.
\\
\indent As a final test for this microlensing dataset, we performed an identical AIROPA analysis while omitting the target itself as a PSF reference star. Ideally, the results of such a test will reveal the influence (if any) that the target (i.e. brightest star in the field) has on the PSF modeling and extraction as well as the fitting parameters and residuals measured by the single-PSF and variable-PSF algorithms. The results of this re-analysis show indistinguishable results for the astrometric and photometric precision for the microlensing target ($\sigma_{r}=0.223$ mas, $\sigma_{m}=0.025$ mag), as well as an FVU value that is consistent (within 1$\sigma$) of the value measured while including the target as a PSF reference star.

\subsection{M53} \label{sec:results-m53}
As described in Section \ref{sec:m53-data}, the two M53 datasets have significantly different data qualities. In particular, the PA 0 dataset has the largest variance in SR, FWHM, and RMS WFE of all data in this study. This is largely because the observing window for the PA 0 data spans a time frame where the DIMM and MASS monitors recorded a particularly high seeing measurement (right panel of Figure \ref{fig:dimmmass_datasets}, green-colored data). This is likely due to high cirrus cloud cover or other turbulent layers in the high-alitude atmosphere during some of the PA 0 exposures. A relatively small total number of PA 0 images were taken on the night (see Table 1 of \cite{service:2016a}), and the frames that correspond to the DIMM/MASS spike seen in Figure \ref{fig:dimmmass_datasets} happen to be the images that have the most observed sources in common with with the PA 90 images that were taken approximately one hour later in the night. Because we want to maximize the total number of cross-referenced stars in both PAs, we chose to keep the PA 0 frames that were captured during the DIMM/MASS spike. We note that AIROPA (and the Arroyo software) associate only two of the six total PA 0 images with the large DIMM and MASS measurement.

\subsubsection{M53 PA 0} \label{sec:result-m53-pa0}
A total of 72 stars were cross-matched across all PA 0 frames, with 10 of the stars used to build the initial PSF model. The location and brightness of the selected PSF reference stars are given by the colored data points in the bottom panels of Figure \ref{fig:m53_image_grid}.

\subsubsection{HST Cross Reference} \label{sec:m53-hst}

Figure \ref{fig:m53_PA_compare_hst} shows the astrometric residual quiver plots in the upper panels, and corresponding distribution of residuals in the lower panels. The astrometric residuals are shown in.
\\
\indent We use the HST photometric measurements as an absolute standard to compare the NIRC2 single-PSF and variable-PSF photometry against. We do this by generating a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for each mode, where we compare the HST I-band and Keck K-band color against the Keck K-band magnitudes for all cross-matched stars in each catalogue. We then use SPISEA to generate a stellar isochrone for the cluster, given a cluster age, metallicity, and extinction law from the literature (CITE).

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Gaia Cross Reference} \label{sec:m53-gaia}

\indent The star lists from both PA's were matched and transformed to Gaia EDR3 \cite{brown:2021a}. There were a total of 32 matched stars between both PA's and Gaia, which can be seen as the star symbols in Figure \ref{fig:m53_aen}. The quiver plots in the top panels of Figure \ref{fig:m53_PA_compare_gaia} look nearly identical because the astrometric differences between the two PSF modes is significantly smaller than the astrometric difference between the NIRC2 and Gaia positions. The distribution of astrometric residuals for both PA's peaks at $\sigma_{r}\leq5$ mas, and the faintest stars have the largest residuals, as expected. Generally, the Gaia residuals are large for several reason; the coordinate system transformation between NIRC2 and Gaia is larger than NIRC2 to HST because the Gaia astrometric precision is much larger than HST (or NIRC2), particularly in crowded stellar fields (CITE). Additional considerations need to be made when matching the two PA's to Gaia (i.e. astrometric fitting errors described in \cite{brown:2018a} and \cite{brown:2021a}). In particular the ``astrometric excess noise ($\epsilon$)" parameter is described as the excess uncertainty that must be added in quadrature to obtain a statistically acceptable astrometric solution. Further, the excess term $\epsilon$ is introduced in order to effectively reduce the statistical weight of observations that may be affected by things like instrument and attitude modeling errors. Initially, 32 stars are cross-matched to Gaia, of which 30 have $\epsilon <  10$ mas, which corresponds to less than 1 NIRC2 pixel (Figure \ref{fig:m53_aen}). Further, we make a cut at $\epsilon <  5$ mas (Figure \ref{fig:m53_aen} vertical line) to reject noisier stars by this metric, which leaves 24 Gaia stars used for the final transformation. More information on this astrometric noise term is given in \cite{lindegren:2012a}. A final detail worth noting is the PSF-fitting and source extraction are not strictly centroid-conserving. This means the flux weighted centroid that is measured by AIROPA does not represent the `true' centroid position, and is particularly important for off-axis stars that suffer from significant anisoplanatism. This effect is estimated to be at the ${\sim}5$ mas level, at worst.

%----------------Discussion and Conclusions------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Discussion and Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

\indent We have analyzed several on-sky NIRC2 datasets with the the single PSF mode and spatially variable PSF mode in AIROPA. We find that the performance of AIROPA is reliable across different conditions including poor, average, and good quality seeing, crowded and/or sparse stellar fields, varying numbers and brightnesses of PSF reference stars, and in different telescope PA's.
\\
\indent Our analysis of the datasets show marginal or no improvement in astrometric residuals between the static PSF model and spatially variable PSF model within AIROPA. A comparison of the FVU metric between the two modes show similar results. This implies that the ability of AIROPA to reconstruct the PSF for a wide range on-sky data remains limited by unaccounted for aberrations in the telescope. We also show that the effect of varying atmospheric conditions, number and spatial location of selected PSF reference stars, and telescope PA do not have a significant effect on the performance of AIROPA in either of the modes.
\\
\indent Comparing the FVU metrics between PSF fitting modes across all datasets shows at best a ${\sim}5\%$ improvement in bright stars for the spatially varying PSF model over a static PSF model. This is significantly less than what has been shown in similar tests on simulated GC data \cite{Turri:inprep}. For OB150029 we measure an astrometric precision that is ${\sim}5\%$ smaller for the variable-PSF mode over the single-PSF mode. However, the FVU metric for this target does not follow the same improvement seen in the astrometry. For the M53 data, we find that the astrometric residuals between single and variable-PSF modes are quite similar when transforming a stack of PA $=$ 0 frames onto the PA $=$ 90 reference frame. Further, when transforming the two PA's to the Gaia and HST reference, we find astrometric residuals at the $\sim 10$ mas.
\\
\indent We largely confirm the result of \cite{Turri:inprep} which shows no significant improvement in fitting residuals for the spatially variable PSF mode in AIROPA with on-sky data. It is hypothesized that there remains static or quasi-static instrumental aberrations that persist in the telescope and are not being fully characterized by afternoon phase diversity measurements. Future on-sky phase diversity measurements should help in identifying the source(s) of instrumental aberrations that are not currently accounted for in fiber phase diversity measurements.
